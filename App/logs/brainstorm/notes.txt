# March 2024:

nameofplace
long
lat
address
phone
stars
prices -- foreign key to another table for the prices belonging to this place

good?

question is how to get this information

for user to see results/places these things need to happen:
- user sends their location, either city or precise location (long, lat) to backend

- user picks filter for results:
	- cheapest
	- most expensive
	- best reviews
	- worst reviews

- backend generates the results based on filter and location
- backend shows results to user and displays the distance to user and place via matrix api
- by default the results would be produced via closest dist to user
	ex: filter is cheapest, user sees cheapest places closest to them
	ex: no filter, user sees places closest to them


(future map visualization)
- with those generated results, we would have name of places of whatever needed to use google map api


searching for exact location will behave differently
- no filter
- display closest places with respect to the textinput of user
